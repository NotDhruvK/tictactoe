determine if the player has won


All functions:
  input_conversion()
  row_checker()
  column_checker()
  diagonal_checker()
  win_determinator()
  winner_print()
  clear_board()
  print_data_structure()





    TO DO:
1.

DONE:
  1. Winning mechanism
  2. String to int function
  3. Clear board.


Winning determination:
Will keep repeating the function call until true (initialized to false)
Will need 3 functions one each for rows, columns and diagonals.
  For rows
    will check the row elements and store them in a string.
    If the string == "XXX" or "000" then win = true
  For columns
    Will check the elements in the columns and store them in a string.
    Same as above
  For Diagonals
    Same as above

A function which will check all the rows, columns and diagonals
for 'X':
  the function will check the diagonals followed by rows followed by columns.
  Will return 1 if X has won
  Will return 2 if 0 has won
  will return 3 incase of draw

Game _tracker()
  Will check if the game is completed or not
  Will return a bool true if game is completed and false if not.
  if Bool is true process stops.

      For the game to be finished:
        Either X has won
        or 0 has won
        it is a draw.


turn tracker -> Will verify whose turn it is
input function -> Will convert the string input into int
board changing function -> will change the board as per the above integers

  print_engine is useless.
  We need 2 programs.
  A first program which will update the data structure
  And a second program which will print out the date structure.
